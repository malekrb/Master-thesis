My thesis project is foculised on dort emotional stories genration in comparison with the human written stories. The thesis is based on the International Database of Emotional Short Texts (IDEST) which represents 250 human-written multilingual short emotional stories. In this repository you will find a Jupyter notebook illustrating an example of code used in the data analysis. The notebook contains 2 parts: the first part is for finetuning GPT2-medium on IDEST short human written stories and story genration using the finetuned model. The second part of the notebook illustrates an example of the sentiment analysis with the sliding window approach on the IDEST dataset.
