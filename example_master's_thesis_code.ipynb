I went to a hairdresser before the party and received an amazing hairdo. They used a lot of hairspray at the hairdresser’s, so it’s going to be difficult to untangle my hair. They also back-combed my hair into an elegant beehive, which makes it even more difficult to handle. It would be a shame to undo such a fantastic hairdo, but I want to untangle my hair before going to bed. I know that in the morning, it would be even more difficult to untangle. I brush my hair carefully, starting from the sides. I hold my hair from the roots while I work through it. This way, brushing hurts less. When I have worked through my hair on the sides, I start untangling the back using a mirror. I work through my hair in small sections and my hair straightens and untangles surprisingly easily.

We left, my parents and I, for a destination that was unknown to me, distant, which would separate me by ten thousand miles of my family and my friends: New Caledonia.

Someone stretches a hand to help me. I am on the floor and the others were aware of it before me. And how I hate that they offered to help me. The anxiety and humiliation are suffocating, like ropes around my neck. I leave the esplanade almost running, looking for a refuge. I cannot find one. I sit in the shadows. I remember I am in mourning, but I cannot remember why. I realize I am hearing rumblings of voices, but there is no one around me. Two hours later, it starts raining.',\n",

The contagious happiness of those who are helped, especially the smaller ones, makes me nostalgic and proud of when I was a child. Across the table, the others cannot contain their excitement. They look constantly over my shoulder, until they tell me, excitedly, to look back. With tremendous surprise and instantly enthusiasm, I see my best friend right next to my mother.

I wonder if he knows he is too big, but I understand … I have not seen him in months.

On our regular way we saw the stray dog which was looked after by the people nearby, sleeping on the sidewalk. But it was lying in the middle of the sidewalk like it owned it. When we were passing it, my mother jokingly extended her leg, saying \"Would you please step aside?\" The dog woke up in shock, tried to escape but couldn\\'t find a route through all the parked cars and attacked my mother instead.

It was a small town on the Karadeniz coast. Usually I spent my time with my nephews. Occasionally I went swimming with friends. Whenever we went to the beach, my sister got all tense. She wasn't wrong, Karadeniz shore is a dangerous place to swim. One day we went swimming, and didn't tell my sister. We had a great time at the beach, playing cards, dancing and singing. It was a fun day. Then some of us decided to swim: it was so shallow that we could walk in the sea. Then my foot slipped and I found myself in a hole on the sea bed. I couldn't release myself from this hole. When my friends realized the situation, they tried to rescue me but none of them was strong enough to pull me up. The water was pulling me deeper and deeper.

I was so embarrassed and waited there a little longer while trying to hold the pain in. When I came to, I realized those weren't her friends and decided to go home.\",\n",

Lost my breath. Women lying on the street, covered in blood. Silent screams covered all the street. But nobody can hear them, and never did before. I felt my time was near. But peace invaded me. This ferocity will find its place in history. Maybe this will save our children. I will die for a reason. I felt I would be useful again after a long time. Peace invaded me. I heard the cracking noise of the door opening. Made my last prayer. I prayed for peace, only for peace. The door opened wide. Rude voices of boots, breath that stank of cigarettes came closer. I felt the coldness of the barrel on my skin. He pulled the trigger. Like the others, I fell on the ground covered in blood. When I was about to give my last breath, I caught his eye. It was him. The one I took cake recipes to, went shopping with, my neighbor whom I talked to while dropping our kids at school. How did we end up like this? Why did we become enemies? We killed in the past, now it was his turn. There was no triumph in his eyes. We both know it wasn't a victory. We said our goodbyes. He left. I died.\",\n",

I started my daily routine: smoke two cigarettes, feed the cats, water the plants, think about unimportant small details about life, smoke another cigarette, brush teeth, leave house. I was joyful like I hadn\\'t been for a long time, and that got me worried. I entered the shop to buy a coffee. I faced someone energetic and smiling. He asked me how I liked my coffee. Suddenly my punch hit his face. In return he said, \"What happened, Sir? Are you OK?\" This got me angrier. I grabbed his hair, tugged the board marker pen from his mouth, and after hitting his head on the case a few times he was silenced. Now he was angry, too. He threw the coffee which was made for the fat ass customer who was late for work into my face. Jumping through the counter he punched my chin real hard. I came to, opened my eyes. The cashier said \"Sir?\" while waiting to write my name on the cup. I took my coffee, and left the shop in peace to go to work.',\n",

There are a few memories I still remember but the one that affects me most happened when I was at kindergarten. My mom and dad dropped me to kindergarten as every other day. After some time, our teacher gathered us all in the playground and the doors were closed. Everything was normal for me up until this moment. Suddenly the door opened halfway, somebody was trying to enter while doing weird moves. Actually the one who was trying to enter was a clown who was here to entertain us. But his weird clothes and movements, even though I don't understand fully why, caused me to tremble in fear. I started crying, and naturally the clown tried to calm me while doing funny things. But it didn't help, I ran and tried to leave the room. Because of my reaction, the clown couldn't stay any longer and left without doing his performance.\",\n",

Me and one of my best friends, Cem, have a match against our old club. I could not play in the match because I injured my heel in a stupid match before. I wanted to play this match so much that I cried when my friends took their position on the court. We had a good start and took the lead. At half time, we went to the locker room in advance. When the team returned from the locker room, we had the same opponent but a different referee team. In the very beginning, we could not get how our two coaches were sent off without reason. Twelve teenagers, 15 years old, felt like fish out of water. I was running to the hall, taking our coach's commands and conveying them clumsily to my friends. There were players who had cramps, who injured themselves to get the ball. Unbelievable motivation. I haven't seen such a dedicated and connected twelve players. The match nearly came to a draw but for our coaches and ourselves: we pushed our limits and won the match. In the end we were so happy. It was an extraordinary youth match. After that we saw that referee team four times and they conducted the matches appropriately.\",\n",

I was ten years old and the first to get home. My parents left work together and picked up my brother on their way home. The time in between passed a little weirdly for me. From the moment I stepped into the house I started crying, thinking that they would have an accident and die. Different reasons each day: sometimes I cried about losing my brother, being alone, missing them, or if I was not too sentimental I cried about not having someone to knit me a sweater. I ran to the balcony immediately and watched the road. When I saw our blue car on the street, I'd be surprised and happy, and wash my face quickly so that they couldn't tell that I had cried. Every weekday for a year passed like this, then it was summer break again. One weekend morning, when I was not waiting, my parents left home to go to school for an examination duty. They had an accident on the way and got crushed by a truck with our blue car.\",\n",

We were very close for years. We went to different schools but we were always together. After high school, we got separated. I came to Ankara and he stayed in Izmit. Our relationship got thinner but we kept in touch. One day I had a phone call: they said Selim was not fine, he was acting weird. I went to Izmit immediately. I wasn't sure whether he was happy to see me or not. He wasn't talking at all. I asked to go out. We walked. Once we were sitting, I asked what was wrong. He said they are following him, they are going to kill him. It was hard to convince him otherwise. I stayed with him for a few days then returned to Ankara. They diagnosed Selim with paranoid schizophrenia, and he stayed in hospital for a few days. Medicine was expensive and his family couldn't afford it. He got aggressive without his medicine. Three years passed. His family and friends were mad at him and I heard they got sick of him. One day I had another phone call. When he was alone at home, he opened the gas and let the room fill with it then he flicked a lighter. He was in hospital for ten days. I called but he didn't want to talk. He stayed in an ice bath for his burns. He died: I cried. What an unfair world.\",\n",

I and five animals are living in this house: it's not a big house but I haven't heard any complaints yet. I always liked animals and enjoy living with them. First I adopted a cat, then a dog, then the rest followed. The only thing I had a hard time getting used to is the pad pad sound at nights that comes from their paws when they walk on the hard floor. At nights there is always this sound: they get up to eat, play, go to the toilet, etc. One of them is always awake even though the others are sleeping. For many nights I stare at the ceiling wide awake waiting for all of them to fall asleep. Those moments are too rare and they pass too quickly: before I fall asleep, one of them wakes up. So, the only solution is getting used to this sound, and that's what I did. After years, lately I have been lying in bed awake listening to the sounds that are coming from outside my door. Like I said, these sounds won't bother me normally, but I have been living alone for some time and it bothers me.\",\n",

Long story short: we are not a barbecue family. That's why when my daughter insisted on having a barbecue I couldn't say no, I didn't want to. That day, a friend of my wife came to visit from out of town and wanted to meet. So when I was left alone with the twins I wanted to change the plan and have barbecue on another day. But how would I convince the kids about not doing something I had promised to? Our neighbor who overheard us said he was alone too and we could take care of it together: hearing this I said OK. When I fired up the barbecue, I realized things were different. It turned out that only two people from his already crowded family was missing. Luckily, his grandfather also fired up his barbecue and saved the day. While all this was happening, my boy didn't listen to me at all and insisted on standing like a pole to watch the other neighbors who were trying to host their guests.

My mother stayed for two days than complained about how sitting was making her pain worse. She wasn't wrong. She was very old and had many problems: rheumatism, sciatica, diabetics, tremors that come and won't go away for days. She is dragging her old body with legs that look like they are only there to complete the picture. When she started to complain about her pains again while looking at me wanting to leave, I sent her home pretending to insist on it. It was a very happy moment for Fethi. He wasn't happy about bringing my mother and spending hours at the hospital. He doesn't even like me. He was putting up with me for his aunt's sake. It's okay. I thanked him in a manner that fits our relationship and informed him that his visits were over. I can say that it was the moment he liked me most. I didn't talk to almost anyone at the hospital for 5 days. It wouldn't matter if I was at home anyway. There was nothing left to talk about there anymore.\"]"
